# NNtime
Building a Neural Network from scratch ? Python3

1. Reading about NNs and what they actually are

https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/neural-network#:~:text=An%20artificial%20neural%20network%20learning,output%2C%20usually%20in%20another%20form.


NN = neuron

Piece of program that takes an input, uses network of functions to translate input into output

No need to hard code characteristics, just give it training data, labeling what is needed and train it on it.

Functionsn needs to be accurate and useful i.e. abstract the data, pinpoint certain data features etc. e.g. cat = 2 eyes 1 nose 1 mouth round head 2 ears
